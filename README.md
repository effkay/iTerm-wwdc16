# WWDC16 Theme for iTerm

**Check out [Jeff kreeftmeijer's
version](https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/wwdc16.terminal) that is a more
acurrate reproduction, offers Terminal and iTerm support as well as dark and
light mode**

The theme is inspired by the colors used in Apple's WWDC16 material. It is based
on Jeff Kreeftmeijer's [Terminal Theme with the same
inspiration](https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/wwdc16.terminal)

Only dark mode so far. Works well with vim default colorscheme.
